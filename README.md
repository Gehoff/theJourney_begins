First Projects

After learning some python I decided my first git project would be a password storing
application.  This one using SHA256 to store a password to any site string (plain text)

Useful for me especially to test my passwords so I don't get locked out of a site

Issues - IT IS JUST A PERSONAL PROJECT
Security issues will only be of main concern if 
it gets released.

Plans - To be able to retrieve all stored sites in plain text.

GUI enhancements and features

No plans (for now) to be able to retrieve the password. Unless I feel like brute forcing the 
hash until the earth crashes into the sun.

All code and files are for learning purposes as of now
