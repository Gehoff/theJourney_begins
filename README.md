pwProtect (My First Branch)

After learning some python I decided my first git project would be a password storing
application.  This one using SHA256 to store a password to any site string (plain text)

Useful for me especially to test my passwords so I don't get locked out of a site

Plans - To be able to retrieve all stored sites in plain text.

GUI enhancements and features

All code and files are for learning purposes as of now
